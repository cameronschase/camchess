# CamChess
This is an application written in Python in which you can play a game against a chess engine I implemented using the famous Minimax Algorithm. As you play moves, the evaluation bar on the right side will change to evaluate who is winning and you can even go back in time to previous moves to analyze your position. There are many different features I've implemented to make it very close to the Chess.com and Lichess layouts while at the same time preserving some of my own chess idiosyncracies present in the heuristics.
